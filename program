We have waited with much anticipation for this day
to arrive and we are very thankful that our families and friends
could be here to share this blessed experience with us.
We are grateful for the distances that many have traveled
to be here with us today. The love of everyone here warms
our hearts and fills us with cherished memories.

We would especially like to thank our parents
who have not only helped us so much with the
planning of this day, but loved and supported us,
and have given us both beautiful examples of what
a marriage and family should be.

LOVE,
Matthew & Carolyn
